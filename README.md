## Description
This website allows user to enter which LCMS instrument (LCMS 2, 5, 6, or 7) it ran on and upload the .csv file from ascent. It will then compare the data from the run to the established means of that instrument. It will look at parameters peak area and retention time, for both the internal standard and parent analyte, of all the analytes within the P2 assay. For any given analyte, if the peak area is equal to or greater than the established mean for that instrument, AND the retention time falls within the acceptable window, that analyte will pass. If either of these parameters are not met, that analyte will fail. If 20% or less of the total analytes fail, then the entire run will return a pass. If more than 20% of total analytes fail, it will return a fail for that run. Each run will be stored in the local storage and can be accessed by searching for previous runs bby instrument.
